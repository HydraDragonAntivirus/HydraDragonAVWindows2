Scanning my own yara rules with my yara rules causes false positives and that's too normal. Other antiviruses also can get false positives when scanning yara rules.
It loads yara signatures at start so please wait.
Known issues: IDDQ GodMode Rule detects Avira etc. so to avoid false positives I'm not going to use that but you can use it. Slow scanning to fix that remove optionnal YARA rule (biiggest one)
You can use United.txt button for get out from false positives at MaliciousIP list YARA rules.
Thanks to: Black Banner for helping my journey.
